Pramaan — Confidence Indicators & Refusal Patterns
=======================================================
Turns a raw retrieval relevance score into a human-readable confidence
LEVEL, and makes the refusal decision explicit and testable — rather
than a single hardcoded number buried inside app.py, as it was in Disha.

Explain it simply: a weather forecaster doesn't just say "70% chance of
rain" and stop — they also tell you what that number means for whether
to carry an umbrella. This module is that translation step for Pramaan's
retrieval scores.
