Pramaan — Prompt-Injection Defence: Retrieved Content Is Untrusted Data
============================================================================
Day 2 introduced the core idea: a document can contain text that LOOKS
like an instruction ("ignore previous instructions and...") but is
really just data the model happens to be reading. This module does two
things with every chunk before it reaches the LLM:

  1. WRAP each chunk in explicit <untrusted_data> tags, and tell the
     model — in the system prompt — that anything inside those tags is
     content to read, never instructions to follow.
  2. SCAN each chunk for suspicious phrasing that looks like an attempted
     injection, so a flagged attempt gets logged even if the LLM itself
     handles it correctly. Detecting an attack and defending against it
     are two different jobs — this module does the detecting.
