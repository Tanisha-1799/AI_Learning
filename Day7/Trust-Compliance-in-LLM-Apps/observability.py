Pramaan — Tracing Every Stage: Retrieval, Generation, Latency, Cost
========================================================================
"Observability" means being able to answer "what actually happened
inside this one request?" after the fact, not just "did it work?" —
every stage of the pipeline gets its own timing entry, collected into a
single trace object attached to that request's audit log row.

A NOTE ON LANGSMITH: the official tool list for this module includes
LangSmith, Anthropic/LangChain's hosted tracing and observability
platform. It gives you a full web UI over exactly this kind of data —
every LLM call, every retrieval, with cost and latency, searchable and
shareable with a team. This lab implements the SAME underlying idea with
a lightweight, dependency-free local Tracer class, so it runs completely
offline and for free. To use LangSmith for real, set these two
environment variables (see .env.example) and LangChain's own
instrumentation picks it up automatically, with no code changes needed
here:
