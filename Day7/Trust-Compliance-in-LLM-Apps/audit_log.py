Pramaan — Audit Logging: What to Log, How to Store, How to Query
======================================================================
WHAT to log, per request: a timestamp, the (PII-redacted) question, which
sources were retrieved and with what scores, the confidence level and
whether the pipeline refused, whether an injection attempt was flagged,
whether output validation passed, the final answer, which sources were
actually cited, latency, and token usage. Enough to reconstruct and
justify every answer Pramaan ever gave, without storing anything that
shouldn't be stored (raw PII never reaches this log — it's redacted
before logging, not after).

HOW to store: a real SQLite database (audit_log.db), one row per request,
in a single table with typed columns — queryable with plain SQL, not
just a growing text file no one can search.

HOW to query: see audit_query_tool.py for a runnable CLI with example
queries (refused requests, injection flags, slow requests, requests
citing a specific document, etc.).
